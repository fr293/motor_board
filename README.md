This motor control board is designed to work with the [Open Flexure microscope](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope) and connect to a Raspberry Pi.  It is based round three parallel ATTiny 841 microcontrollers with ULN2003 Darlington transistor arrays operating at 5V. The motor is a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with a 64:1 gear ratio.
